```

## Contact Form Implementation

The contact form uses Nodemailer to send emails. In development mode, it uses Ethereal Email to simulate email sending without actually delivering messages.

To view test emails in development:

1. Fill out and submit the contact form
2. Check the console logs for preview URLs
3. Open the preview URLs to see how the emails would look

In production mode, real emails will be sent using the configured email provider.

## Logo and Branding

The MG logo is provided in SVG and PNG formats in the `/public` directory. The logo is used in the header, favicon, and email templates.
